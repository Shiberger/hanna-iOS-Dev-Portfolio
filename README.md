### 👋 Hi! I'm a junior iOS Developer. Here's a bit of what I've been working on university!.


# [HearCare Application](https://github.com/Shiberger/HearCareApp)
`🏦 This application was developed as a thesis project for the National Research Competition of Thailand 2025`
The project was developed in collaboration with doctors at HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn Medical Center to ensure real-world clinical applicability. It was successfully submitted to the National Research Competition in Thailand, demonstrating its potential as a valuable tool for hearing health monitoring in both clinical and home settings.
This application bridges the gap between professional hearing healthcare and personal health monitoring, making audiometric testing more accessible while maintaining clinical standards.

# Key Features
- Clinical Hearing Tests: Implements pure tone audiometry testing following the Hughson-Westlake protocol, the gold standard for hearing assessments
- Interactive Audiograms: Visualizes test results in professional-grade audiograms using Swift Charts
- Personalized Analysis: Uses a CoreML model to classify hearing health and provide tailored recommendations
- History Tracking: Monitors hearing changes over time with detailed historical data
- Secure User Management: Integrates Firebase authentication and Firestore for secure data handling

**Tech Used**
- 💿 Swift and SwiftUI for UI development
- 🎨 Firebase ecosystem for backend services
- 🏦 CoreML for hearing classification and analytics
- 🎁 AVFoundation for audio generation and hearing test implementation
- 📲 MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture


# [MoveMate](https://github.com/Shiberger/MoveMate)
MoveMate is designed to provide an intuitive navigation experience with a focus on exploring and managing destinations. The application allows users to search for locations, save favorite destinations, and get detailed navigation instructions with estimated travel times.
The app is structured around two main tabs:

- MoveMate Map - The primary navigation interface with real-time location tracking, search functionality, and route visualization
- Destinations - A management interface for saved locations with the ability to organize and access favorite destinations

MoveMate showcases advanced iOS mapping capabilities with features like Look Around scene previews and custom style configurations while maintaining a clean, user-friendly interface built on SwiftUI's declarative paradigm.
